Homework
--------

There are eight problem sets for this course. Undergraduate students should answer 2 out of 4 questions on each of the first five problem sets, and then answer all questions on the remaining problem sets. Graduate students should answer 3 out of 4 questions on each of the first five problem sets. The [term paper](#termpaper) takes the place of the other three problem sets for graduate students.

{{< anchor "termpaper" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Term Paper
---------------------------------------------------

Students enrolled in the graduate course must complete a term paper. The term paper is to answer a question based upon information available in the literature. It is not a research paper, demanding original intellectual contributions. Your paper should answer the question, noting important uncertainties, areas of unavailable knowledge and including a critique of the information in the literature. You should not become an advocate for a policy or position. Please choose a topic that is of interest for a term paper. Do not pick a topic that you are working on or have worked on as a project already – we want you to look into something outside of your main expertise.

### Timeline

A term paper prospectus is due in Session #4. In your prospectus, please provide us with the following information:

1.  What is the question?
2.  Why is the answer important?
3.  What are the important elements and phenomena?
4.  What literature resources are available? List at least four.

We will return your prospectus with feedback during Session #6. If there is significant interest in a few topics, we may ask people to choose a different topic. A revised prospectus incorporating these comments will be due in Session #8.

Once topic selections are finalized, advisors will be assigned to each project in Session #11. These people should be seen as a valuable resource to guide you in seeking out sources and understanding methodologies.

You will be required to turn in an outline of your paper during Session #17. We will comment on it and help you get a good start. Please include an abstract, an introduction to the problem, the relevant research you have found reported (with references to the sources at the end of the paper), your assessment of the data and your conclusions. This will also require you to identify any gaps, discrepancies, or uncertainties in the information used as a basis for your conclusions and include your findings. Each paper is expected to review the state of the art on the topic and do some independent analysis and assessment that add insight to the topic.

A final draft of the papers will be due Session #20– there will be no extensions. Papers will be reviewed and returned with feedback in Session #23. During Finals Week, you will have an opportunity to turn in a more finalized version of your paper based on the feedback.

### Guidelines

The most important rule for these papers is quality over quantity. Take the space you need to say what you need to make your argument. Beyond that, some general formatting guidelines:

*   20-30 pages, including figures and references
*   1.5x spacing
*   12 pt font size
*   1" margins
