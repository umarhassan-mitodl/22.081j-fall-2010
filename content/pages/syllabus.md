Periodically, lecture sessions will be replaced by recitation sessions.

Description
-----------

This class assesses current and potential future energy systems, covering resources, extraction, conversion, and end-use technologies, with emphasis on meeting regional and global energy needs in the 21st century in a sustainable manner. Instructors and guest lecturers will examine various renewable and conventional energy production technologies, energy end-use practices and alternatives, and consumption practices in different countries. Students will learn a quantitative framework to aid in evaluation and analysis of energy technology system proposals in the context of engineering, political, social, economic, and environmental goals. Undergraduate students enroll in _Introduction to Sustainable Energy_ and graduate students enroll in _Sustainable Energy_.

Undergraduate Requirements
--------------------------

### Assignments

One problem set is given per three class meeting days, on average. The first five problem sets focus on analytical skills and are shared with the graduate students; later problem sets are more comprehensive and integrating. Eight problem sets are assigned; undergraduates should complete 2 of 4 questions per problem set for the first five problem sets, and then answer all of the questions in the remaining three problem sets.

### Exams

There will be two take-home midterm exams and one final exam administered to students enrolled in the undergraduate offering.
